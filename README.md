# The Developer Experience Automator

This tool is intended to help make managing multiple Github repositories much easier for DX, DevRel, and Open Source Engineering teams. 

Please check out the [develop branch](https://github.com/sendgrid/dx-automator/tree/develop) to see what's going on.

We will update this README and the master branch, as well as deploy the code to pypi once the MVP is ready!

## Attributions
We believe in open source and want to give credit where it's due. We used the amazing tutorial at [testdriven.io](https://testdriven.io) to guide us in setting a solid foundation using flask, docker, and (eventually) node and react. From this tutorial, we began to build and iterate.
